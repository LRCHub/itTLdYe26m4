[00:37.26] One more day, go and cross it out
[00:39.88] And a year's already flying by
[00:43.59] This dark place puts a darker ring
[00:45.97] And a tear in every living eye
[01:00.97] 
[00:49.60] What if I told you, it's all a lie?
[00:52.13] And the truth will set you free... my advice?
[00:55.61] Just lose yourself in my fantasy
[00:58.21] For a small and meager price...
[01:13.71] 
[01:00.48] And we could fly! Fly! Fly over evergreens
[01:04.10] It's everything you could want to be
[01:06.95] Just sign your soul over here to me
[01:09.96] The world one dream away
[01:21.96] 
[01:12.65] But before you do, just know you will not return
[01:15.86] This here's one bridge that you gotta burn
[01:19.08] So ask yourself, did you really earn
[01:22.32] The world one dream away?
[01:34.82] 
[01:37.22] We both know this was never real
[01:40.13] But the song was welcome to your ear
[01:43.38] You could stay in the fantasy
[01:46.03] To escape the agony of fear
[01:59.53] 
[01:49.50] What if I told you, you're in control
[01:52.02] And you're free to carry on... Just ignore
[01:55.53] Those who would tell you to stop your roll
[01:58.28] And forget the right and wrong...
[02:14.78] 
[02:00.87] And we could fly! Fly! Fly over evergreens
[02:04.05] It's everything you could want to be
[02:07.29] Just sign your soul over here to me
[02:10.23] The world one dream away
[02:22.23] 
[02:12.97] But before you do, just know you will not return
[02:16.06] This here's one bridge that you gotta burn
[02:19.26] So ask yourself, did you really earn
[02:22.03] The world one dream away?
[02:34.53] 
[02:49.35] One more day, go and cross it out
[02:52.24] And a year's already flying by
[02:55.20] This dark place puts a darker ring
[02:58.16] And a tear in every living eye
[03:13.16] 
[03:01.57] What if I told you, it's all a lie?
[03:07.21] Just lose yourself in my fantasy
[03:09.88] For a small and meager price...
[03:25.38] 
[03:24.45] But before you do, just know you will not return
[03:28.31] This here's one bridge that you gotta burn
[03:31.23] So ask yourself, did you really earn
[03:34.21] The world one dream away?
[03:46.71] 
[04:12.27] And we could fly! Fly! Fly over evergreens
[04:16.29] It's everything you could want to be
[04:19.19] Just sign your soul over here to me
[04:22.09] The world one dream away
[04:34.09] 
[04:24.82] But before you do, just know you will not return
[04:28.03] This here's one bridge that you gotta burn
[04:31.08] So ask yourself, did you really earn
[04:34.15] The world one dream away?
